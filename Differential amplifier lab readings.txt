when both voltages are connected to the ground:
voltage across collector resistors
VR1 = 6.1V
VR2 = 6.1V
Similarly currents across the resistors is
IR1 = 0.0061A
IR2 = 0.0061A
Voltage across emitter resistor of Q3
VR5 = 1.23V
Similarly current across the resistor is
IR5 = 0.00123A

Note: Vo1 and Vo2 are measured just above Q1 and Q2 resp.
When ac 100mv p-p is connected to the Q1 as vi1
Vo1 wrto ground = 1.7V
Vo1 is out of phase wrto Vi1
Vo2 wrto ground = 1.7V
Vo2 is in phase with Vi1

Single ended differential voltage gain
(Ad)s = -34 (for Vo1)
(Ad)s = 34 (for Vo2)

when Vi1 = 0V
Vi2 = 50mV p-p

Vo1 = 1.7V, in phase with input
Vo2 = 1.7V, out of phase with input

Single ended differential voltage gain
(Ad)s = 34 (for Vo1)
(Ad)s = -34 (for Vo2)

When Vi2 = 50mV and Vi1 is grounded
Vo1-Vo2 = 3.4V
WHen Vi1 = 50mV and Vi2 is grounded
Vo1 - Vo2 = 3.4V

Double ended differential voltage gain:
WHen Vi1 is grounded
(Ad)D = 3.4/50mV = 68
When Vi2 is grounded
(Ad)D = 3.4/50mV = 68

When Vi1 = Vi2 = 1Vpp
Vo1 = 5.4mV = Vo2 both out of phase with input

for single ended
(Ac)s =5.4*10^-3
(Ac)s =5.4*10^-3

As for double ended Vo1 = Vo2 so difference is 0
(Ac)D = 0

So CMRR = 75.98
